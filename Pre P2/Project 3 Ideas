//------- Testing Variables ------\\
1 - Number of Inital Threads
2 - Recursivley checking directory initally for thread count
 	Recursively to get names and valid csv files (Put them into a data struct (Link list for the easy of adding without realloc)) O(|dir| + |file|) BFS 
		Then create threads run a thread for each file and do the appropriate ops O(|linkList|) 
			Mergesort O(n log n)
3 - Preallocate a large number of threads to hope for no reallocation
